# Prerequisites

1. Ensure your JAVA_HOME variable is set.
2. Know the package name for the client you want to dump.

# Usage

1. Download both jars from the Releases tab, and place them on your desktop.
2. Launch Minecraft Forge with the mod you would like to dump.
3. Once the game is fully loaded, open CMD. If you want to be extra careful about being undetected, turn off your Wifi.
4. In CMD, type `java -jar ` and drag in `injector.jar`. You need to provide one argument, which is a key class/package word for the client.
  - For example, dumping pyro would require `pyro`, dumping future would require `futureclient`, and etc.
5. Hit enter and wait for the dumper to finish processing.
6. When the dumper is finished, there will be a new file on your desktop called `kami-b10-release.jar` containing the dump. At this point you can close the game and turn your Wifi back on.
